      Partage has been operating programs in Cambodia since November 1989. Then it started by basic supports and it has developed progressively project focusing on education particularly in pre-schools and primary schools in rural areas and some villages surrounding target schools. There were six primary and six pre-schools in three provinces (Takeo, Kompong Speu, and Kandal) under Partage’s projects during the period of 1989 to 1999.

    <p>
      By July 1999, Partage Cambodia had been localized as “Bandos Komar Association”, which became a local NGO in order to take over all Partage’s projects. Since 2002, BK has expanded its programs to new target provinces such as Pursat in 2002 and Siem Reap in 2008.
